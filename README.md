**Status: [Initial Development](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0-rc.1.html#spec-item-5)** - Everything works, but is still being abstracted and tailored to aws-nuke and azure-nuke,
as such func signatures and other things may change in breaking ways until things stabilize.

## Overview

This is an attempt to consolidate the commonalities between [aws-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke) and [azure-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/azure-nuke) into a single library
that can be used between them and for future tooling, for example [gcp-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/gcp-nuke). Additionally, the goal is to make it
easier to add new features with better test coverage.

## Attribution, License, and Copyright

First, of all this library would not have been possible without the hard work of the team over at [rebuy-de](https://github.com/rebuy-de)
and their original work on [rebuy-de/aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke).

This library is licensed under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information. The bulk of this
library was originally sourced from [rebuy-de/aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke). See the [Sources](#sources)
for more.

## History of the Library

This all started when I created a managed fork of [aws-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke) from the [original aws nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke).
The fork became necessary after attempting to make contributions and respond to issues to learn that the current 
maintainers only have time to work on the project about once a month and while receptive to bringing in other people
to help maintain, made it clear it would take time. Considering the feedback cycle was already weeks on initial
communications, I had to make the hard decision to fork and maintain myself.

After the fork, I created [azure-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/azure-nuke) to fulfill a missing need there and 
quickly realized that it would be great to pull all the common code into a common library that could be shared by the
two tools with the realization I would be also be making [gcp-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/gcp-nuke) in the near
future.

### A Few Notes About the Original Code

The code initially written for [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke) for iterating over and clearing out resources was well-written, and I wanted to use it for other cloud providers. Originally I copied it for [azure-nuke,](https://github.com/ekristen/azure-nuke) 
but I didn't want to have to keep on maintaining multiple copies.

There are a few shortcomings with the original code base. For example, there's no way to do dependency management. For 
example, some resources must be cleared before others can, or it will end in error. Now, the retry mechanism is **usually** sufficient for this, but only sometimes.

The queue code was very novel in its approach, and I wanted to keep that, but I wanted to make sure it was
agnostic to the system using it. As such, the queue package can be used for just about anything you want to queue
and retry items. However, it is still geared towards the removal of said it, its primary interface has to have the `Remove` method is still available.

The goal of this library is to be able to be used for any cloud provider, but anything that wants to use a similar
pattern for iterating over and removing resources.

## Sources

Most of this code originated from the original [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke) project.

- [aws-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke)
  - was originally a managed fork, it's now been split entirely from the original project, too much divergence
- [aws-nuke original](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke)
- [azure-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/azure-nuke)

## Versioning

This library will follow the semver model. However, it is still in alpha/beta and as such the API is subject to change
until it is stable and will remain on the `0.y.z` model until then.

## Packages

I strongly dislike using the `internal` directory in any open-source Golang project. Therefore, everything is in `pkg`
and exported wherever possible to allow others to use it.

### errors

These are common errors that need to be handled by the library.

### featureflag

This allows arbitrary settings to be passed into the library to enable/disable certain features.

### filter

This allows resources to be filtered on a number of different scenarios.

### log

This is a simple wrapper around `fmt.Println` that formats resource cleanup messages nicely.

### nuke

This is the primary package used to iterate over and remove resources.

### queue

This is a queue package that can be used for just about anything but is geared towards the removal of resources.

### resource

This is the primary resource package that is used to define resources and their dependencies. To be used by the `nuke` 
package and the `queue` package.

### types

This is a collection of common types that are used throughout the library.

### utils

This is a collection of common utilities that are used throughout the library.
