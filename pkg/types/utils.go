// ResolveResourceTypes resolves the resource types based on the provided includes, excludes, and alternatives.
// The alternatives are a list of resource types that are to be used instead of the default resource. The primary use
// case for this is AWS Cloud Control API resources. If a resource has been registered with the Cloud Control API.
// Includes, Excludes, and Alternatives are []Collection because they are a combination of runtime, global and account
// level configuration.
